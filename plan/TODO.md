* Make google-forms-invitation to teaching assistants

# Decisions 

## To Be Decided

* Decide on licensing for derivative material from previous course
* AnvÃ¤nda MCL:s bok?
* Use Ammonite?
* CS lab lib dir structure in workspace: cslib or se.lth.cs.pgk.
* Src dir structure in workspace: src/paket eller src/main/scala/paket
* How many team labs?
* When to place the first team lab?
* Keep collaboration bonus to the exam?
* Should collaboration bonus not affect approval and only higher grades?
* Scala 2.12?
* Investigate if we can/should apply these tutorials in the course:
  * http://www.tutorialspoint.com/scala/
  * http://scala-ide.org/docs/current-user-doc/features/scaladebugger/index.html 

## Decided

* Language English or Swedish?
  * **Swedish** for the body of the compendium and for lecture slides. *RATIONALE:* All students in the current course know Swedish; native speaking improves learning. Translation can come later.
  * **English** for all other stuff in the repo and its documentation. *RATIONALE:* All contributors are assumed to know English. Prepare for translation contributions to English and other languages.

* Structure of compendium? Integrated Modules Theme{Theory+Exercises+Labs} or separate parts for labs and exercises separated from the theory?
  * **Integrated modules** *RATIONALE:*  Easier to follow each module as a trail of weeks.

* Use sbt?
  * **NO** for students on student machines; unclear how to best centralize ivy cache 
  * **YES** for the repo building process - teaching assistants use sbt to build the repo 

* Decide on licensing for new material
  * **CC BY-SA** *RATIONALE:* Copy left license increase the chance of this repo to be useful by others and create most value out of tax payers money.
 
 
* Which collection should be our favorite beginner collection? Vector || List || Array 
  * **Vector**  *RATIONALE:*  Array is mutable and == does not work as expected and generic parameters need a context bound: [T : reflect.ClassTag]. Introduce Array later as a performance optimization when we are ready to discuss the difference between reference and structural equality. List has the "strange" cons syntax, which makes more sense after pattern matching and recursion have been introduced.

```
    scala> def f[A : reflect.ClassTag](n: Int) = new Array[A](n)
    f: [A](n: Int)(implicit evidence$1: scala.reflect.ClassTag[A])Array[A]

    scala> f(42)
    res0: Array[Nothing] = Array(null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null)

    scala> f[Int](42)
    res1: Array[Int] = Array(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
```
